  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example does all steps to configure and enable a NEO-M8P-2 as a base station:
    Begin Survey-In
    Once we've achieved 2m accuracy and 300s have passed, survey is complete
    Enable four RTCM messages
    Begin outputting RTCM bytes

  Feel like supporting open source hardware?
  Buy a board from SparkFun! https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14980

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GPS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
